I love playing word games and was a part of the fanbase who would play the daily wordle I created this program as a modified version of wordle for my family's enjoyment. My modifications include: both length of word and number of guesses will be arbitrary, no numerical or textual constraints in our tools to allow different letters other than A-Z.
